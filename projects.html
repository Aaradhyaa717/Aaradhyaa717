          <h2>1. Study of Gun Violence in United States</h2>
          <p>Research question: How do gun ownership, population, median income, and political affiliation affect the number of mass shootings or the number of victims of mass shootings per state?</p>
          <p>In this project, we examine the correlation between gun ownership, mass shooting victims, and other socio-economic factors. We developed a multivariate regression model to predict the number of mass shootings and victims across states.</p>

          <h2>2. A Novel Method for Signal Processing Inspired Stock Prediction</h2>
          <p>This project seeks to identify patterns between various data sources to predict airline stock values. We developed an algorithm for matching changes across data streams and applied multiple linear regression to test its effectiveness. The method filters data to highlight significant trends and remove noise.</p>

          <h2>3. RoyalFlush: BlackJack Game using OCaml</h2>
          <p>This project is a simple implementation of the classic card game Blackjack, built using OCaml. The game allows players to compete against the dealer, following standard Blackjack rules. Players can hit, stand, double down, and split pairs, while the dealer follows specific rules for drawing cards..</p>
